      <h3>Descrition</h3>
      <p>
        I'm excited to share what is one of my all-time favorite things to
        grill. This is perfect for those times when you want to take a break
        from grilling burgers, but you also kinda want a grilled burger, since
        this is basically a Mediterranean-style meatball on a stick. I know
        "shish" gets more love, but "kofta" might be the best kebab. Serve over
        a tomato, onion, and cucumber salad with flatbread or pita and a lemony
        tahini dressing.

      <h3>ingredientes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 slice whole grain bread, toasted</li>
        <li>½ medium yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>⅓ cup chopped Italian parsley</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>8 ounces ground beef</li>
        <li>4 ounces ground lamb</li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>4 bamboo skewers, soaked for at least 1 hour</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cut toasted bread slice into thin strips on a cutting board; cut
          strips across into a small dice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place onion, parsley, and garlic on top of diced bread on the cutting
          board; chop until mixture resembles tabbouleh.
        </li>
        <li>
          Season beef and lamb with kosher salt, black pepper, allspice,
          paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, and cayenne. Add onion mixture and water.
          Mix and mash with your hands until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour,
          up to overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove meat from the refrigerator and roll ¼ of the mixture into a
          ball using wet hands. Pierce in the middle with a bamboo skewer. Shape
          meat into a uniform log, about 6 inches long and 2 inches wide.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat a charcoal grill until coals are very hot.</li>
        <li>
          Place kebabs on the hot grill until browned and cooked through, about
          12 minutes, turning every 3 minutes or so. An instant-read thermometer
          inserted into the center of a kebab should read at least 145 degrees F
          (63 degrees C). Serve.
        </li>
      </ol>
